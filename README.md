### SOLID Principles

#### package com.design.principles;

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   - A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job or responsibility.
#### Examples

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
#### Examples

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
#### Examples

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
#### Examples

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
